# Bad Children on Airplanes?
I chose to look at public opinion regarding unruly children on airplanes because I found this question more leading compared to a question, of, say, babies on airplanes. As expected, the leading presence of the word "unruly" in the question led a vast majority of respondents to find the practice rude. I wonder if the questions being worded differently would lead to different responses, and I wonder how strong the leading effect is.
